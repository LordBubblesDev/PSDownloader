SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A PowerShell module for downloading files with multi-threaded support.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSDownloader is a PowerShell module that provides robust file downloading capabilities
    with features like multi-threaded downloads, progress reporting, hash verification,
    automatic retries, and pipeline support.

    The module exports a single cmdlet:
    - Start-Download: Downloads files from specified URLs

FEATURES
    * Multi-threaded downloads for improved speed
    * Progress and speed reporting
    * Hash verification (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, CRC32)
    * Automatic retries on failure
    * Pipeline support for batch downloads
    * Multiple user agent options
    * Segment retry on failure
    * Cross-platform support

EXAMPLES
    Download a file:
        Start-Download -Url "https://example.com/file.zip"

    Multi-threaded download:
        Start-Download -Url "https://example.com/file.zip" -Threads 8

    Download with hash verification:
        Start-Download -Url "https://example.com/file.zip" -ExpectedHash "1234ABCD" -HashType SHA256

    Pipeline support:
        Get-Content "urls.txt" | Start-Download -Destination "D:\Downloads"

NOTE
    The default behavior is unthreaded downloads. Multi-threaded downloads are
    automatically disabled for servers that don't support range requests or don't
    provide content length.

TROUBLESHOOTING
    If downloads fail:
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Verify the URL is accessible
    3. Try with different user agent settings
    4. Try switching to multiple threads or unthreaded mode
    5. Increase timeout value for slow connections
